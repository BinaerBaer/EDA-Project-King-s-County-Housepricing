## Fictional business case: The prefabricator

I will look at the King County Housing dataset from the point of view of an analyst at a Housing Company which is focused on prefabrication. They have a set of 4 Housing types and are thinking whether to expand into King County local business or not. My task is to take a look at the local market and estimate housing prices.
